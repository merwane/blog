This is my corner of the www.

I build and destroy things for fun. I mostly write software but recently got hooked to robotics. The most important things we should be focusing on are creating AGI, building (and rendering) the metaverse and decentralizing governance. At least two of these things heavily involve crypto. Definitely shoot me an email if you're into one of them.

I rarely take time to redraft what I write, but I casually post things here to [get better](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) at it.
