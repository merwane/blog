I recently started a company with my friend [Rosco](https://twitter.com/roscokalis) and we went through Y Combinator for the W22 batch. We didn't apply with the same idea that we're currently working on, but ended up pivoting after a month and got the most out of the program. The core problem is still the same: Blockchains are hard to understand and transactions should be human-readable. We thought the solution was going to be some sort of search engine or a better block explorer, but decided to work on an API instead.

A lot of consumer software problems usually involve taking a human-to-human system and making it easily accessible and readable by computers. Something like Plaid took the banking system —a set of protocols that are mostly meant for humans-to-human interactions— and made it easy for computers to talk to each other using them. We think that crypto needs a reverse approach. Most protocols on Ethereum are meant to be understood and accessed by computers, and that makes it hard for humans to understand what’s happening or interact with the protocols. It sounds a bit counter-intuitive, because you normally wouldn’t try to go from SMTP to physical mail, but it’s possible that this is what crypto needs to improve its UX for regular consumers.

The industry has been growing exponentially and it's hard to do everything at once. Instead of trying to create a product that will encapsulate the entire crypto experience —and do a poor job at some things that other companies do really well—, we've decided to just build the base layer that will help other create better and more human experiences. It's itchy to say that we're working on crypto infrastructure, but it has become lame to say that in 2022 (similar to how everyone was building a "platform" in the 2010s).

We're calling it [Chaingrep](https://chaingrep.com), and our mission is to do to Blockchains what Apple and Microsoft did to computers. If you want to work on a lot of challenging problems [with us](https://chaingrep.notion.site/chaingrep/Chaingrep-is-hiring-a2868f107f3849ab84e85ff109748d4f), you should [reach out](mailto:jobs@chaingrep.com).
