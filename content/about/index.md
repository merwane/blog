I'm Merwane. This is my corner of the www.

I work at [Armada](https://tryarmada.com), where we're building a search engine for NFTs (we're trying to organize the metaverse!).

The most important things we should be focusing on in tech are creating AGI and building permissionless infrastructure for the metaverse.

I casually post things here and rarely take time to redraft what I write, but I am trying to [get better](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) at it.
