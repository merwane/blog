I genuinely believe that we're living inside a simulation (think of it as a virtual machine), but that it'll be very hard (or impossible?) to hack our way out of it, because we only have a shared state in common (a memory address?), and the hypervisor is way too strict to let us play with the register. So in the meantime, I build things (often with the purpose of destroying other things), and work on what I think is interesting and challenging. I casually post things here and rarely take time to redraft what I write, but I am trying to [get better](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) at it.
