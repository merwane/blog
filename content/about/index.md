I'm Merwane.

I live in Germany and grew up in Algeria. I did some work for a few tech companies, usually after cold emailing them, and often experienced the Zoom jetlag as most of them were based on different time zones. I started doing that when I was 17 and got paid in cryptocurrency as I didn't have access to banking. I am now 22 years old and spend most of my time working on a couple of side projects, including a [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) for Ethereum and a remote code execution engine that could serve as a base layer for things like a more extensive [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) or an online IDE (although [Replit](https://replit.com/) already does that pretty well). Odds are that I'll end up focusing on just one of these and bury the other projects in my GitHub graveyard. 

Even with the rise of remote, and other emerging tech hubs, I'd move to the SF Bay area if I could. I like the idea of SF being the [Schelling point](https://patrickcollison.com/advice) for high-openness, smart, energetic, optimistic people.


I am not good at writing, but I casually post things here to [get better](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) at it.
