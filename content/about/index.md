I genuinely believe that we're living inside a simulation (think of it as a virtual machine), but that it'll be very hard (or impossible?) to hack our way out of it, because we only have a shared state in common (a memory address?), and the hypervisor is way too strict to let us play with the register. So in the meantime, I build things (often with the purpose of destroying other things), and work on what I think is interesting and challenging. I casually post things here and rarely take time to redraft what I write, but I am trying to [get better](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) at it.

I also believe that we're witnessing an unprecedented western decadence, and that we need to do all we can to preserve American/western supremacy and dominance (mostly in terms of talent and technology). All cultures are not equal, and some are better than others. We can't afford to let a state like China steer our future. The best way to do this is to create a genereation of independant thinkers and to revive the American industrial dynamism, instead of telling every kid that they should pursue their dream of becoming streamers and influencers (30 years ago the typical answer was astronaut!). I rarely talk about politics, so here's a summary to save you some time in case you want to conduct an investigation: I am a libertarian, and I probably lean republican (although I'm not a U.S citizen). I'm only writing this here because I want to signal that you can work in tech and think a bit differently. I believe that the tech sector is vastly monocultural despite claiming the opposite, and that imposing one model of thinking is fascism. My political views have absolutely nothing to do with my company Chaingrep. You can work there if you're a democrat, a marxist, or a fish, as long as you're a good engineer who's able to work with other engineers without fighting about how many genders there are and all that kind of stuff. Seriously, nobody cares about that if you're cool or refreshingly smart. 

Some good reads:
- The Sovereign Individual
- Zero to One
- Paul Graham's essays
- Masters of Doom

If you're 16-29 you should:
- Think about building something (anything!)
- Learn to hack (it's a superpower and will help you think)
- Drop out of university if you already know what you want and feel like you're wasting your 20s.
- Instead, you can start a company and apply to YC where you'll meet way more unconventional people.
- Read all these books.
- Not be in TikTok.

If you're 30+:
- Do the 20s stuff minus the drop out part.
