I'm Merwane. This is my corner of the www.

I work at [Armada](https://tryarmada.com), where we're building a search engine for NFTs. We're trying to organize the metaverse â€“ [join us](mailto:merwane@tryarmada.com)!

The most important things we should be focusing on during this decade are AGI research and building infrastructure for the next iteration of the internet (the metaverse).

I casually post things here and rarely take time to redraft what I write, but I am trying to [get better](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html) at it.
